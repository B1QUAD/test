# test
A simple (and really dumb) bash script I made in ~5 minutes bodged together with bits from stackoverflow to become the ultimate 420x engineer.
In case you could not tell this is satire [Poe's law check]

# Please do not use this script, it's very dumb and there are better ways to commit code every day such as making small yet meaningful
changes to your projects.
